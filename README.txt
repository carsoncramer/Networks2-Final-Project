I am still working towards my November 1st deadline of gathering research before beginning to start making changes to the network. I have found two new papers that I think have some interesting ideas, but they are pretty similar to the research papers I explored in my project proposal. Over the next few days one area I am going to be researching more is dealing with interference from walls and obstacles in wireless networks, because that is potentially a big issue that I think could be degrading the network.
