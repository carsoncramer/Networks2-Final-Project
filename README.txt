I am still working towards my November 1st deadline of gathering research before beginning to start making changes to the network. I have found two new papers that I think have some interesting ideas, but they are pretty similar to the research papers I explored in my project proposal. Over the next few days one area I am going to be researching more is dealing with interference from walls and obstacles in wireless networks, because that is potentially a big issue that I think could be degrading the network.

November 3rd update: I found some papers discussing interference due to walls and obstacles. I think that the knowledge is potentially useful when planning a building layout, but since I am working with an already established landscape, I will just need to do the best I can to ensure as many users as possible can have line-of-sight to an access point. I am slightly behind schedule on getting the initial measurements. It has been much harder to coordinate 30 people in passing. I plan to use a bit of our time during the chapter meeting to get everyone to take a measurement at the same time. I also sourced around 200 feet of ethernet cables, which I am going to be using to provide wired internet to as many members as possible. This will hopefully reduce the wireless interference caused by having so many devices on the network.
